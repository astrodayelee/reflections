did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    yes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    As I can see the history of modification, as it is automatically saved 
in VC, it helps to find typos or compare the improvement with the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Google docs can save my unwanted change to the file, but maybe I can 
just forget to manually commit the change in Github.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    convenient, when tracking multiple files that are related each other, such as html & css,
or chapters of novels.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log ; show history of commits, message, ID
git diff ID1, ID2 ; show differences made, red for deletion, green for addition

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because the formal history is already stored, so don't have to worry of 
spoiling the former file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Through checkout, I can check which commit caused the bug...
